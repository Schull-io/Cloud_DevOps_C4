# Creating and Pushing Container Images to ECR
In this lab, you will containarize any application of your choice and push the image to AWS ECR(private regsitry) 
## Tasks: 
- Create any application in any programming language of your choice (*it can be as simple as **hello world***)
- Create a `Dockerfile` to build the application
- Build the application locally using `docker build` commands and tag the image appropriately
- Run the image locally to ensure it's running well
- Push the image to AWS ECR (**You will need to login to AWS ECR**)
